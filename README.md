# bookmarklet-library
A small library of bookmarklets (javascript-powered, executable bookmarks)
to improve your browser experience.

All bookmarklets can be found by browsing the `bookmarklets/` folder.

To use bookmarklets, add the `javascript:` code as a bookmark, preferably in the bookmarks bar, and
click the bookmark to run the associated code.
